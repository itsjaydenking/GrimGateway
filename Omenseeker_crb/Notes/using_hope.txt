Example 1: Using Hope
Scene Context: A Seeker faces a crumbling bridge and must leap across to escape an encroaching enemy.

Player 1: "I jump across the gap!"
Rolls their dice pool but falls short of the required successes.

Player 1: "Iâ€™ll spend 1 Hope to reroll two dice and try again."
Rerolls and succeeds with just enough to cross safely.

Game Master: "Your leap lands you safely on the other side, but the bridge collapses behind you."
