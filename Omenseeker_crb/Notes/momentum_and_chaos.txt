Momentum vs. Chaos in Play
This interplay between Momentum and Chaos creates a dynamic, evolving narrative. Players leverage Momentum to solve problems, while the GM uses Chaos to ensure stakes remain high.

Example 3: Balancing Momentum and Chaos
Scene Context: The Seekers are infiltrating a Revenite crypt to recover an ancient artifact.

<table><thead><tr><th>Player Action </th><th>Momentum Earned/Spent </th><th>Chaos Gained/Spent </th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Player 1 succeeds on a Test by 2 points. </td><td>+2 Momentum (banked in the group pool). </td><td>— </td></tr><tr><td>Player 2 spends Momentum to ask a question. </td><td>-1 Momentum. </td><td>— </td></tr><tr><td>Player 3 triggers a complication. </td><td>— </td><td>+1 Chaos (generated by Player 3 to negate the complication). </td></tr><tr><td>GM introduces additional guards. </td><td>— </td><td>-2 Chaos (used to reinforce NPCs). </td></tr></tbody></table>

Game Master: "The extra guards arrive just as you spot the artifact. Their arrival increases the tension, but you now have 3 Momentum left in your pool to adapt."
