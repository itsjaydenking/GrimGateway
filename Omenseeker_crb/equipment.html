    <h1>Gear and Equipment</h1>
    <p>A Little Something for Everyone</p>
    <h2>Economy and Trade</h2>
    <p>
      Characters begin the game with a certain amount of wealth. This represents
      both currency and valuables they have. Valuables may include rare items,
      supplies, and more.
    </p>
    <h3>Wealth and Value</h3>
    <p>
      Several factors affect characters' and objects' purchasing power. Their
      Wealth Points (¤) measure the general value or currency available to a
      character.
    </p>
    <h4>Item Rarity</h4>
    <p>
      All items have a rarity rating from 1 to 5. Higher rarity represents
      scarcity, regulation, or legal consequences to have. The rarity of an item
      provides several points of information for the Game Master (GM) and
      players.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Price. Rarity determines the amount of Wealth Points involved in buying
        or selling an item. Characters may only receive Wealth Points equal to
        half the rarity (rounded up).
      </li>
      <li>
        Haggle. Rarity determines the Difficulty of a Test to increase or reduce
        the price for buying or selling.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discovery. Rarity determines the chance of locating the item and its
        condition.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Rarity may increase or decrease depending on the region, charaters,
      communities, and type of item.
    </p>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Item Rarity</th>

        <tr>
          <td>2</td>

    </table>
    <h3>Bartering</h3>
    <p>
      Items listed later in this chapter provide a standard cost of wealth. This
      is the value to either buy or sell the item. Different groups may consider
      items worth more or less than the listed cost.
    </p>
    <p>
      Items of a higher Technique Level than the buyer counts their cost as half
      (rounded up), as the object isn't helpful for them to have.
    </p>
    <h4>Lost Remnants</h4>
    <p>
      Information about the world and its history fills the landscape. This
      information is a form of power in the right hands, the power of Lost
      Remnants. The fragments of the world, both past and present, have value.
      The value may be more or less for different groups.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Lost Lore. Information connected to the world before the Grim
        Sublimation. These are facts about people and places that existed before
        they faced destruction.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lost Legends. Information connected to the state of the world since the
        Grim Dawn. These are facts about people and places that currently exist.
        The focus is information that is unknown to most and otherwise a secret.
      </li>
      <li>
        Lost Legacies. Information connected to specific people and places
        relevant to other individuals or communities. These are facts about
        people and places recently dying or facing destruction. The focus is
        information on details that people have lost.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Aethernauts</h5>
    <p>
      These communities tend only to buy goods when they need them. Their
      particular magical abilities allow them to sustain necessities. They
      regard Lost Lore and magical objects as worth 50% more than the listed
      cost when buying or selling. They do not care for anything industrial or
      similar in technology that isn’t magical.
    </p>
    <h5>Erathans</h5>
    <p>
      These communities produce most of what they need. They are more likely to
      sell their surplus in exchange for things they cannot produce. They will
      pay 50% more for goods or services they cannot produce. They will never
      buy any items of a higher Technique level than the buyer. Neither do they
      care for any Lost Remnants or anything magical.
    </p>
    <h5>Mythoterics</h5>
    <p>
      These communities only buy goods and services related to the services they
      provide. They focus on getting weapons, armor, and information for hunting
      or defending. There is an interest in Lost Legends within range of a
      community’s territory or borders.
    </p>
    <h5>Revenites</h5>
    <p>
      These communities tend to buy and sell everything. They can produce most
      things they need but believe everything is useful. They are particularly
      interested in Lost Remnants and will pay 50% more for Lost Legacies.
    </p>
    <h5>Technocrats</h5>
    <p>
      These communities are willing to buy any goods or information they don’t
      already have. They will pay 50% more for goods that they don't already
      have. Particularly goods that have a Technique higher than the buyer. They
      tend to have no interest in natural resources or Lost Remnants.
    </p>
    <h3>General Gear</h3>
    <p>
      Many items that people use tend to be older made. Repaired or refurbished
      items recovered from ruins make up the majority of gear. Although one may
      discover these ancient items, they are far from the only source of gear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any community of a sustainable size will have crafters. These individuals
      know forging techniques and practical skills. Forging allows the
      alteration of minerals, ceramics, plastics, and fabrics into useful forms.
      Forgers with an understanding of industrial or magical influences can push
      limits.
    </p>
    <p>
      In game terms, each item listed has a category describing the forging
      method. Most state the type of material or knowledge required to produce a
      brand-new version of said item.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Hand Made. Hand-made refers to items crafted by hand. Examples such as
        making a club from wood or a knife from metal debris. Some items may
        take more work to craft but shouldn't need any form of industrial or
        magical help. Advanced hand-made include smithing such as a rudimentary
        sword or metal woven armor.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deep Forged. Deep Forged refers to items made with a powered forge of
        some kind. These items may use deep metal, referring to an alloy with
        trace Grim Light. Grinding deep metal into a fine powder allows the
        creation of firearms. Most deep forged items tend to be large, unwieldy,
        or complex for handmade techniques. Industrial or magical resources are
        necessary to craft these items.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cyber Forged. Cyber Forged refers to items made using technology that
        includes nanowire and nanoweaving. The process uses Ethedian, a
        lightweight metal, weaving it into specific items. Cyber Forgers need
        precise schematics for the material to replicate through weaving. Some
        describe these processes as three-dimensional printing.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rune Forged. Rune Forged refers to items made using powerful magic and
        sometimes ancient forces. Powers greater than most can fathom bless the
        process involved in crafting items. Forging magical items needs a
        flexible material capable of holding ample magic. Orikhalos is a dense,
        fibrous material akin to wood with the toughness of metal. Using this
        material charges the item and grants magical resistance.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Miscellaneous Gear</h4>
    <p>
      Some items may not fall into any of these specific forging categories.
      Reasons include lack of knowledge for production to the limit of energy
      necessary. Rather than forging them, people have these items through
      discovery and restoration. These include specialized facilities, vehicles,
      and distinct magical technologies.
    </p>
    <h4>Grim Charged Objects</h4>
    <p>
      Many items found, and several produced, across the world are Grim Charged.
      These items radiate subtle but distinct New Clear energy that draws on the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      A charged object requires this energy to function. No one has to track how
      much energy is available in a given object. If the item has energy, then
      it works.
    </p>
    <p>
      Charged objects have the energy drained when used during a Test. Draining
      a charged object during a Test takes one dice from the pool and sets it to
      "12" immediately. The object also generates two short-term Harmony on the
      success of the Test. Draining the object of its energy is impossible if
      the Test does not include a d12.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once drained, the object loses any energy until refreshed. Objects, such
      as weapons, work as normal without the grim charge if possible.
    </p>

    <h5>Refreshing Charged Objects</h5>
    <p>
      Charged objects refresh at different rates depending on the objects.
      Objects may list Quick, Short, or Long for their refresh rate. These refer
      to the type of rest the owning character needs to refresh the object.
      Charged objects created using Supply points cannot refresh.
    </p>

    <h2>Weapons</h2>
    <p>
      People find settlements far from danger, but the world is still perilous.
      Threats linger from arcane storms and slumbering mechs to the ark rifts
      and Light Eaters. Some seek information lost to the world, and others
      explore the unknown rifts. A person may carry simple weapons meant to hunt
      or defend themselves. Others may choose more imposing armaments to express
      their ill intent.
    </p>
    <h3>Weapon Traits</h3>
    <p>The following traits describe weapons in Light Omens RPG</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Name. The weapon’s name or brief description. This is also considered
        the weapon’s Truth.
      </li>
      <li>
        Technique Level. The complexity of the weapon. This compares to the
        Technique level of the character for effective use.
      </li>
      <li>
        Weapon Type. The weapon’s combat type. Weapons work either as melee or

      </li>
      <li>
        Damage Effects. The weapon’s damage comes in two parts. The first is a
        single word or short phrase which is the Injury the weapon inflicts.
        This injury becomes a Truth when inflicted. The second is the damage
        rating, a number from 1 – 6 which is the cost to avoid the injury by
        spending Hope. Weapons with square brackets describe stacked injuries,
        such as Shrapnel [x2].
      </li>
      <li>Qualities. The weapon’s other listed qualities.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Damage Effects</h4>

        non-lethal.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shrapnel. Covers most effects that include multiple points of impact and
        damage.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Weapon Qualities</h4>
    <p>The following are common weapon qualities.</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Ammo. This weapon is either consumed on use or has consumable resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        Burst. This weapon may damage several targets at once. This includes
        explosions, many projectiles, or areas of effect. When targeting an NPC
        group, extra targets cost 1 Harmony instead of 2.
      </li>
      <li>
        Breaking. This weapon reduces the protection gained from armor. Armor
        and NPCs list how much protection they provide against breaking attacks.
      </li>
      <li>
        Charged. This weapon relies on New Clear energy to function. Characters
        may drain the weapon when making an attack.
      </li>
      <li>
        Discrete. This weapon remains hidden and undetectable (+1 Difficulty) by
        those looking at the character.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heavy. This weapon is bulky and harder to use (+1 Difficulty). Using
        proper support or leverage counters the weight problem.
      </li>
      <li>
        Long Ranged. This weapon allows further ranged attacks than other
        weapons. The character ignores the Difficulty of increasing the firing
        on a target at long range.
      </li>
      <li>Loud. This weapon makes a lot of noise when used.</li>
      <li>
        Non-Lethal. This weapon allows incapacitation without lasting damage.
        Injuries inflict by this weapon heal and disappear when treated or at
        the start of the next scene.
      </li>
      <li>
        Planted. These weapons need placement as an action and do not trigger
        immediately. A Difficulty 1 Test determines how well-positioned or
        concealed they are. Harmony generated from the placement Test can
        increase the triggered damage rating. The weapon itself doesn't activate
        until triggered.
      </li>
      <li>Quiet. This weapon makes very little noise when used.</li>
      <li>
        Threatening. This weapon is scary, dangerous, or otherwise brings
        concern. Using or having this weapon may affect interactions and
        generate Chaos.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Armor</h2>
    <p>
      Armor provides a character with protection by making it easier to avoid
      Injury. All armor has a protection rating. A character reduces the cost to
      avoid injury by an amount equal to the protection rating.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character may also sacrifice armor to avoid an injury. A character may
      also sacrifice armor to avoid an injury. This destroys the armor, removes
      the protection, and the character is still defeated. NPCs cannot use this
      option.
    </p>

    <h2>Gear and Tools</h2>

      When it comes to equipment beyond weapons and armor, the list of options
      is quite extensive. The following section provides a few sets of personal
      gear and tools available in the game. There are no strict restrictions on
      how many items a person carries, but a Game Master may always impose
      limitations to avoid the endless inventory.
    </p>
    <p>
      This is not an exhaustive list of possible items. A player may always
      suggest an item that does not align with the provided options. They may
      work with the game master to determine the forge type, technique
      requirements, wealth cost, and rarity of the new item.
