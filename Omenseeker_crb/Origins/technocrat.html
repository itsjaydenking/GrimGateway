    <h1>Technocrat</h1>
    <p>
      Technocrats find the obsession with technology to be a potential way to
      improve the world. They collect knowledge and gain advanced skills in
      engineering and programming. These applied sciences work in ways that are
      described as magic to those who are unable to understand them. All
      conflicts, past and future, in the world have a solution that technology
      will deliver.
    </p>
    <p>
      Strong idealism can lead to an ethical disregard for the living and a less
      favorable outcome. Technocrats receive the branding of warmongering for
      ruthless attacks and conquest. Despite aggressive tactics, the tech
      communities grow like few others. Technocrats thrive through structure,
      organization, and dedicated service to their communities.

      crafted charged, you must spend three extra Supply points on top of the
      base cost. Draining the object of its charge breaks it. The object counts
      as a Charged (Quick) for any abilities that refer to charged objects.
