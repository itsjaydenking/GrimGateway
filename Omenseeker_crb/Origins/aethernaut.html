    <h1>Aethernaut</h1>
    <p>
      The essence of magic drives the aethernauts forward, a culture of scholars
      and thaumaturgists driven to explore the depths of magic. Aethernauts saw
      an opportunity after the energy eruption and collapse of the world.
      Choosing to settle near arcane storms, thaumaturgical anomalies, and ruins
      radiating grim light.
    </p>
    <p>
      Aethernaut communities focus on a particular classification of magic and
      its applications. Their pressure on creative freedom to learn and explore
      tends to bring caution to others. Many become uncomfortable with their
      passions and near-fanatical dependency on the arcane. Aethernauts hold the
      most knowledge and Supplies to trade for more knowledge. Aethernauts focus
      on using magic to alter the world around them.

    <h2>Arcane Conduit [Aethernaut Ability]</h2>
    <p>
      Aethernauts understand the fundamentals of thaumaturgy and maximize every
      ounce of energy required.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reduce the Supply point cost to enact sorceries and invocations by 1. You
      also reduce the recovery period of Grim Light buildup by one step. Long
      rests to Short rests, Short rests to Quick rests, and Quick rests to the
      end of the scene.
    </p>

    <h2>Grim Syphon [Aethernaut Ability]</h2>
    <p>
      Aethernauts do not need trinkets or tools when they can do it themselves,
      and they do it better.
    </p>
    <p>
      As an action, you can drain a charged object you are carrying to gain
      Supply points. The object must be of a Technique level less than yours.
      You earn one Supply point after draining a Charged (Quick) object. Two
      Supply points from a Charged (Short) object, and three from a Charged
      (Long) object.
    </p>

    <h2>Synchronized [Aethernaut Ability]</h2>
    <p>
      Aethernauts learn to bend the nature around them, and people feel that
      energy.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may spend Supply points in place of an ally that you can perceive. The
      ally generates short-term Momentum equal to the Supply points you spend.
      The short-term Momentum only applies to the current Test.
