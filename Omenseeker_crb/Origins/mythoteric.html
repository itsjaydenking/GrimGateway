    <h1>Mythoteric</h1>
    <p>
      Mythoterics have a culture derived from and driven by warriors and
      hunters. They wander the wild and abandoned, seeking to destroy what
      threatens their territories. Those of the mythoterics claim to have
      ancestral connections to monsters themselves. Many point to the beast that
      shares their body, mind, and soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      All forms of magic and technology focus on progressing combat and survival
      strategies. Not only are they connected to the beasts of the land, but
      they are also capable of taming monsters. Honor binds some as soldiers,
      while others discover their place in life through peace.

      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Pack Mentality [Mythoteric Ability]</h2>
    <p>
      Mythoterics struggle with their monsters but find a way to ease the pain
      of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may enhance a Truth you create as a benefit for a Bond you have or a
      non-hostile character. For every two Supply points you spend, you increase
      the severity of the Truth created by +1.
    </p>

    <h2>Unleash The Beast [Mythoteric Ability]</h2>
    <p>
      Mythoterics understand the monster inside; some give it the freedom it
      craves.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may generate three Chaos to unleash the beast inside. You gain the
      following effects while the beast remains unleashed.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You gain one Truth related to the beast form.</li>
      <li>You regain one Hope before every action.</li>
      <li>You lose two Supplies after every action.</li>
      <li>You generate two short-term Momentum with every Test.</li>
      <li>You delay Injuries until the form concludes.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you choose to or cannot spend the necessary Supply points, this ability
      ends. Receiving more Injuries than your Technique level also ends this
      ability. At the end of the transformation, you reduce your Hope to zero
      and become Hopeless.
    </p>

    <h2>Wild Instincts [Mythoteric Ability]</h2>
    <p>
      Mythoterics gain knowledge from the world through their unnatural
      instincts.
    </p>
    <p>
      When attempting an action, you may use Talents you donâ€™t have. You may
      spend two Harmony and two Supply points to have a Talent for the action.
      You lose the talent once the action resolves. The same talent cannot be
      chosen more than once per scene.
