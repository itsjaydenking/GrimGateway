    <h1>Revenite</h1>
    <p>
      Revenites do not fear death, understanding its place in the flow of all
      things. Carrying the ambitions and dreams of their ancestors is a rite of
      passage for most. The intention is to channel the past to the future using
      their light. The power they need is not in the world around them, but in
      the legacy passed down to them.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is common for Revenites to focus on blood magics or cybernetic
      enhancements. The modifications through these methods allow them to carry
      their family with them. Others may focus on other body parts, from the
      bones to the spirit. All forms of a person's identity lend to the story of
      their life. Memories are documented in their physical form and recalled as
      stories by others.

    <h2>Grave Meditation [Revenite Ability]</h2>
    <p>
      Revenites connect to death in all forms and find balance through
      morbidity.
    </p>
    <p>
      When resting, you may choose to reduce the Chaos pool instead of
      recovering Hope. You drain the Chaos pool by an amount equal to the Hope
      recovered.
    </p>

    <h2>Memento Mori [Revenite Ability]</h2>
    <p>Revenites carry a trinket that holds the stories of the fallen.</p>
    <p>
      Once per scene, you may recall the stories of the fallen. You roll a
      number of d6s based on your Technique level. Every success generates one
      point of Hope and drains one point of Chaos, and dice cannot be upgraded,
      rerolled, or generate Complications. You may regain Hope whenever you
      gather Supply points around fallen humanoids. You must spend Supply points
      to recover Hope, like Gain Favor or Tempt Fate.
    </p>

    <h2>Revenance Debt [Revenite Ability]</h2>
    <p>Revenites learn early never to fear death, knowing its inevitability.</p>
    <p>
      Declaring you are Willing to Die also recovers Supply points to the
      baseline. You can spend Supply points instead of using Hope to avoid an
      Injury. The Supply point cost equals twice the damage rating. Doing so
      delays the Injury to the end of the scene and increases the severity by 1.
