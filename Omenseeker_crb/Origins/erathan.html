    <h1>Erathan</h1>
    <p>
      Erathans are restless wanderers who thrive in the wilderness. Many Erathan
      specialize in technology and thaumaturgy despite their nature dependency.
      It is common for their communities to avoid the grander or ambitious
      applications. Most focus on sciences such as physics or chemistry. It is
      not uncommon for an Erathan to know mechanics, cybernetics, or artifice.
      They share the information with almost anyone in friendly and inviting
      communities. They emphasize avoiding over-exploitation or overindulgence
      of industrial or magical influences.

      Erathans use their understanding of nature to extract the most potent
      effects.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can enhance a Truth you create as a hindrance by using nature to
      target an enemy. You increase the severity of the Truth created by +1 for
      every two Supply points you spend.
    </p>

    <h2>Obscure Knowledge [Erathan Ability]</h2>

      Erathans avoided complicated powers only because they understood how to
