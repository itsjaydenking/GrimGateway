    <h1>Building Your Legend</h1>
    <p>
      Welcome to character creation in Light Omens. Here, every choice shapes
      your character’s journey and the legacy they leave behind. In the world of
      Light Omens, heroes, adventurers, and scholars often leave their mark on
      those who follow. Whether through Reminiscent Bonds with companions or
      Memorial Bonds with the fallen, your character’s story can inspire future
      generations. As you build your character, a seeker should consider the
      impact they hope to have and how their memory might guide others, even
      when they are no longer there to lead. You are not just creating a
      character for adventures but shaping a piece of the world’s history.

    <h2>Attributes</h2>
    <p>
      A character’s attributes stand for their core abilities. They express how
      capable a character is when trying specific actions. Each attribute has a
      rating from 1 to 6, measuring a character's physical, mental, and social
      aspects.
