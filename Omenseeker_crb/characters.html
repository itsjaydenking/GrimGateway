      <h1>Building Your Legend</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to character creation in Light Omens. Here, every choice shapes
        your character’s journey and the legacy they leave behind. In the world
        of Light Omens, heroes, adventurers, and scholars often leave their mark
        on those who follow. Whether through Reminiscent Bonds with companions
        or Memorial Bonds with the fallen, your character’s story can inspire
        future generations. As you build your character, a seeker should
        consider the impact they hope to have and how their memory might guide
        others, even when they are no longer there to lead. You are not just
        creating a character for adventures but shaping a piece of the world’s
        history.

      <h2>Attributes</h2>
      <p>
        A character’s attributes stand for their core abilities. They express
        how capable a character is when trying specific actions. Each attribute
        has a rating from 1 to 6, measuring a character's physical, mental, and
        social aspects.

      <h2>Approaches</h2>
      <p>
        A character’s approaches stand for a character’s training and
        understanding. They express how effective a character is in a specific
        action. Each approach has a rating from 0 to 4, measuring a character's
        preference for being direct, indirect, or enduring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Below are examples of what a character might accomplish at each level of
        the Force, Finesse, and Focus Approaches. These examples help you gauge
        how your character’s skill level impacts their success in different
        scenarios.
      </p>

          <td>Masterful Approach</td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Force</h3>
      <p>
        Force represents direct, straightforward action. Characters using force
        rely on physical power, straightforward problem-solving, and sincerity.
      </p>
      <h4>Using Force</h4>
      <p>
        Use force when time is of the essence or when the situation requires
        immediate, impactful action that bypasses complexity. Force works best
        when subtly isn’t necessary or when brute strength or decisiveness will
        achieve results more efficiently.
      </p>

      <h3>Finesse</h3>
      <p>
        Finesse involves precision, skill, and subtly. Characters using finesse
        emphasize agility, accuracy, and careful planning.
      </p>
      <h4>Using Finesse</h4>
      <p>
        Use finesse for situations where control and accuracy are crucial. It is
        the go-to approach when a plan needs a subtle or delicate touch or when
        you want to achieve a goal without creating unnecessary chaos.
      </p>

      <h3>Focus</h3>
      <p>
        Focus represents resilience, patience, and endurance. Characters with
        focus rely on their ability to maintain control and persist through
        difficulty.
      </p>
      <h4>Using Focus</h4>
      <p>
        Focus is helpful in situations requiring sustained effort or where a
        calm, controlled approach can prevent errors or fatigue. It’s beneficial
        when staying power and endurance are more valuable than speed or power.
      </p>

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        Methods represent a character’s general behavior and express how
        particular a character is in a specific action. Each method combines an
        attribute and an approach, with rankings from 0 to 6. Each method has a
        descriptor that describes a particular action more specifically. When
        using strength, Body (Force), a character performs a brutal action.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using Methods. Ranks in a method allow you to upgrade your base dice
        pool. When rolling for a specific method, replace up to [X] d6 in your
        dice pool with d12s, where X is the smallest of your attribute and
        approach rating. You can never upgrade more dice than your attribute and
        cannot upgrade any dice if you are hopeless.

        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hope</h2>
      <p>
        Player characters have access to a personal supply called Hope. Hope
        stands for the elements that make them stand out. Hope allows a
        character to push their limits and achieve grand feats. Characters may
        alter the world around them and avoid negative consequences. Characters
        may have abilities that need Hope to perform them. Hope is the extent of
        a character's will to the world and will to live.
      </p>
      <h3>Spending Hope</h3>
      <p>
        Each player character has their own Hope pool set up during character
        creation. There are a few ways a character may spend their Hope.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Upgrade Dice. A character may spend Hope to upgrade a single d6. This
          choice can only apply to the value of the character’s Approach. This
          costs one Hope per upgrade.
        </li>
        <li>
          Reroll Dice. A character may spend Hope to reroll up to two dice in
          their dice pool. This costs one Hope.
        </li>
        <li>
          Avoid Injury. A character may spend Hope to negate a negative
          consequence or impending Injury. Each Injury varies on the Hope cost.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talents. Characters may learn Talents that offer extra ways to spend
          Hope.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Hopelessness</h3>
      <p>
        Hopelessness is a truth that occurs when a character’s hope reaches 0.
        Hopelessness is temporary and occurs if characters push themselves too
        far. A character can choose one of the different forms of hopelessness
        when their Hope becomes 0. Hopeless characters lock down one approach
        depending on the type of hopelessness. A character cannot use any d6s
        from their approach and cannot upgrade any dice with that approach.
        Hopeless characters also generate one Complication when using any
        alternative approach. A hopeless character cannot regain Hope by
        spending Harmony or generating Chaos. Regaining Hope doesn’t remove a
        character’s hopeless state.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Weakened characters lock down their Force approach. The character can
          no longer rely on direct, decisive actions. Physically intense tasks
          become exhausting or impossible, and their intimidation tactics lose
          impact. This forces the character to adapt using more subtle or
          enduring methods.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clumsy characters lock down their Finesse approach. They struggle with
          precision, losing their ability to perform delicate tasks or agile
          maneuvers. They may have to resort to brute strength or simply tough
          it out.
        </li>
        <li>
          Distracted characters lock down their Focus approach. They find it
          difficult to stay composed, losing their endurance and resilience.
          They may struggle to hold their ground and can be more easily shaken.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h4>Handling Hopelessness</h4>
      <p>
        A character loses the hopeless state after completing any rest. An ally
        can remove a character’s hopeless state using a Plan and Prepare action
        to affect a Truth. Affecting the hopeless state is a Difficulty 2 Test.
        Removing the hopeless state from any ally recovers one Hope for each
        character involved. A character who gains the hopeless state gains
        experience. A character who helps another recover from the hopeless
        state also gains experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Technique Level</h2>
      <p>
        Every character has a Technique Level (TL). TL describes a character’s
        affinity to develop or interact with objects or tactics with varying
        complexities. This applies to physical objects, magical elements, and
        technical aspects of the world. Characters can interact with objects
        with a Complexity lower than or equal to their TL. Tests may still be
        necessary in difficult or dangerous situations.
      </p>
      <h3>Complicated Techniques</h3>
      <p>
        Characters without the proper TL face increased challenges when using an
        object. The Difficulty of a Test interacting with the object increases
        by +2 for each difference. A character may try to interact with the
        object with help. Only a character with the proper Technique Level may
        function as an assistant. The difficulty of the Test is only increased
        by +1 for each level difference. Characters trying to use an object
        without the Technique Level also generate Chaos. The Chaos generated
        equals the difference between the Complexity and the Technique Level.
      </p>
      <h4>Collaborative Techniques</h4>
      <p>
        A character may train another character on how to use an object during a
        Long Rest. The trainer must have a technique level that is high enough
        to use the object. The receiving character must have a Technique Level
        lower than the object's. The receiving character receives the mentored
        truth. They treat the Technique Level for the object as one lower level.
        A character may only have the mentored truth for a single object.
      </p>

      <h2>Supply Points</h2>
      <p>
        Every character collects salvaged components, harvested materials, or
        residual arcane energy. These supplies may assemble into tools, items,
        or situational effects. Player characters have a pool of Supply Points
        to stand for this.
      </p>
      <h3>Using Supply Points</h3>
      <p>
        A character may declare they have supplies that help when acting. They
        may declare this regardless of whether the action requires a Test. A
        character describes the supply they are revealing, crafting, or
        conjuring. The Game Master (GM) decides how many Supply Points the
        creation requires. The character gains the object as equipment Truth if
        they have enough supplies to pay the price. The character may try to
        resolve the action with the new object. A character cannot spend more
        Supply Points than their Technique Level on a single creation. Anything
        created this way has a Complexity level equal to one less the cost.
        Also, anything made using Supply Points breaks down at the end of the
        scene.
      </p>

            ingredients.
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Gathering Supply Points</h3>
      <p>
        Once per scene, a player may request to gather supplies. They decide
        whether to collect from natural, magical, or industrial sources. A
        character must make an Attribute (Force / Finesse) Test with a
        Difficulty of 1. On success, the character gains supplies equal to the
        number of dice rolled for the check (+1 for each d12 rolled). A
        character may spend one Harmony to increase the amount gained by +1.
        Places scarce in a specific supply may reduce the amount achieved in
        half (rounded up). Locations with plenty of particular supplies may
        double the amount earned. Any Supply Points a character gains above
        their baseline creates the encumbered Truth. A character can only carry
        a Supply Point equal to twice their baseline.
      </p>
      <h2>Bonds</h2>
      <p>
        Every player character has some connection to other group members. Two
        kinds of bonds form a Truth: friendships and rivalries. A character
        receives one or more bonds during character creation. These bonds aid in
        connecting the player characters within a group. These bonds help
        characters recover Hope while providing Truth.
      </p>
      <h3>Friendships</h3>
      <p>
        If a character has a friendly bond with another character, they tend to
        be more likely to help the other. When a character spends Harmony to
        Gain Favor or provides Hope during a rest for a friend, that ally
        regains +1 extra Hope.
      </p>
      <h3>Rivalries</h3>
      <p>
        If a character has a rivalry bond with another character, they tend to
        push one another to improve. When a character regains Hope by generating
        Chaos to Tempt Fate or spending Harmony to Gain Favor, their rivals
        regain +1 Hope.
      </p>

      <h2>Talents</h2>
      <p>
        A character’s attributes, approaches, and methods do not explain all
        that they are. Talents are extra benefits and abilities of a character.
        Each one grants some mechanical benefits that apply within a set of
        circumstances.
      </p>
      <h2>Putting it Together</h2>
      <p>
        When a player creates a character for Light Omens RPG, follow the
        following steps.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          Select a single Origin for the character. The origin describes where
          the character came from. This is a cultural aspect more than anything.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select an Archetype for the character. The archetype describes what
          the character does. This is about their career and primary skill set.
        </li>
        <li>
          Select a Tendency for the character. The tendency describes the
          character’s default behavior.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These three elements describe a character; you are a(n) tendency +
        origin + archetype.
      </p>
      <h2>Origins</h2>

      <h3>Unknown Origins</h3>
      <p>
        Sometimes a character has mysterious origins. They could have amnesia,
        lost access to their original form, or otherwise not be part of this
        world. This means the character starts without using one of the
        established origins available. This is an advanced choice; a player
        should get the Game Master's (GM's) permission first. The character
        starts with 16 experiences to spend. These points may only increase
        Attributes, Technique Level, Hope, and Supplies. Additionally, the
        character may choose one Special Ability from any available origin.
      </p>

      <h3>Unusual Archetypes</h3>

        Some characters get unique training over their life. They could have an
        exceptional mentor, borrow knowledge, or otherwise not be part of this

        established origins available. This is an advanced choice; a player
        should get the Game Master's (GM's) permission first. The character

        equipment, but the GM may choose to provide wealth or equipment.
      </p>
      <h2>Tendencies</h2>

      <p>
        You should have your maximum Hope value. This equals the number of your
        method [Attribute (Approach)] chosen from your tendency. Any bonuses
        from your origin and archetype further increase it. Remember, characters
        all have a starting +1 for their Hope.
      </p>
      <h3>Calculating Supply Points</h3>
      <p>
        You should have your baseline Supplies value. This equals the bonuses
        gained from your origin and archetype. Remember, characters all have a
        starting +2 for their baseline Supplies.
      </p>
      <h3>Establishing Bonds</h3>
      <p>
        The number of bonds you have depends on the number of players in the
        group. Your tendency is either based on friendship or rivalry. Choose
        one other player character in the group to share a bond with that type.
        This bond goes both ways and is the same for both characters. Any
        subsequent bonds gained by any characters can be a friendship or
        rivalry.

      <h3>Starting Equipment</h3>
      <p>
        Your chosen archetype gives you your starting equipment. Supply Points
        represent other objects, items, and improvised equipment. Each starting
        character begins with 2 Wealth Points. Wealth Points are explained in
        more detail in later.
      </p>
      <h3>Determining Goals</h3>
      <p>
        Every character wants to achieve something. These desires drive you
        forward, giving meaning to your actions. Your goals are split into
        short-term and long-term ambitions.
      </p>
      <h4>Short-Term Ambition</h4>
      <p>
        A short-term ambition is something the character wants to happen soon.
        Ideally, a short-term ambition leads a character closer to completing a
        long-term ambition.
      </p>
      <h4>Long-Term Ambition</h4>
      <p>
        A long-term ambition is the character’s overarching goal. Achieving this
        goal should be considered a major turning point in that character’s
        life. Sometimes, it may be enough to convince a character to retire.
      </p>
      <h4>Achieving Goals</h4>
      <p>
        You gain experience when you complete a short-term ambition and create a
        new one. You and your entire group gain experience when you complete a
        long-term ambition. You can create a new ambition or allow the character
        to retire.
      </p>
      <h2>Experience and Growth</h2>
      <p>
        Several situations describe providing a character with experience. These
        are moments of development and advancement for characters. Experience
        allows a character to grow and learn from these moments. Each session
        provides at least one experience for the table just for participating.
        Characters also gain experience whenever the Game Master (GM) spends
        three or more Chaos at once. Every character in the group receives this
        experience. A character may have no more than nine experiences at one
        time. Any gain over this limit disappears and is no longer applicable.
      </p>
      <h3>Using Experience</h3>
      <p>
        Characters use their experiences to improve themselves. Different
        improvements will have different costs of experience. You may spend any
        amount of experience during a downtime period. It is vital to keep track
        of experience gained and paid as it may be helpful later in the
        character’s life.

      </table>
      <h3>Experience and Ranks</h3>
      <p>
        Characters gain experiences from various sources that help them improve
        themselves. Some characters have experienced enough to stand out among
        their peers. Experience ranks categorize individuals within a specific
        power scale for reference. These ranks are helpful when starting groups
        off with more experience.
      </p>

      <h2>Character Legacies</h2>
      <p>
        Sometimes, characters perish. Sometimes, they decide they’ve found a
        purpose other than adventuring. It's natural for characters to leave a
        group, which may lead to new opportunities for the players.
      </p>
      <h3>Retired Legends</h3>
      <p>A character may retire under two circumstances.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The character has achieved their long-term ambition.</li>
        <li>
          The character has reached the end of an adventure and has three or
          more Injuries.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A retired character settles down in a nearby community of their choice
        and is no longer playable. They are instead an allied NPC. This causes a
        few changes for the group.
      </p>
      <h4>A Friendly Face</h4>
      <p>
        When the group visits their community, the retired friend guarantees
        shelter and hospitality. A long or short rest in a community with a
        retired friend restores an extra 50% of Hope (rounded up).
      </p>
      <h4>News and Information</h4>
      <p>
        The group may contact a retired friend once per session for help.
        Contact may be in person or by alternative means available to the group.
        The group may ask the retired friend three questions about the local
        area and recent events. The Game Master (GM) provides information in
        response to the group.
      </p>
      <h4>Your Turn to Carry This...</h4>
      <p>
        A retiring character selects one item and one bond they have. The bonded
        character receives the selected item and ignores any Technique Level
        requirements. Retiring characters may repeat this for each bond they
        have.
      </p>
      <h4>Shifted Bonds</h4>
      <p>
        Any character with a bond with the retired friend changes that bond to a
        Reminiscent Bond, as shown below.
      </p>
      <h5>Reminiscent Bond</h5>
      <p>
        Note down the highest attribute the former character has. Once per
        session, a character may recall their old friend. The character may roll
        a number of d12s based on the former character’s highest attribute. Each
        success generates a single Hope.
      </p>
      <h3>Fallen Legends</h3>
      <p>
        A fallen character lives on in the memories of their friends. Any
        character who had a bond to a fallen character changes that bond to the
        Memorial Bond below.
      </p>
      <h4>Memorial Bond</h4>
      <p>
        Note down the highest attribute and approach the former character has.
        Once per session, a character may recall their fallen friend. The
        character may roll a number of d12s based on the fallen character's
        highest attribute (approach). Every success grants a single point of
        Hope and reduces a single point of Chaos.
      </p>
      <h3>New Characters</h3>
      <p>
        The player may create a new character if their current character has
        retired or fallen. The player creates the character as they see fit. The
        new character is another legend adding to the world's legacy. A
        character created after the fall or retirement of another character
        gains experience. Any unspent experience of the former character goes to
        the new character. Half of the experience (rounded up) spent by the
        former character also goes to the new character.
      </p>

      <h4>Advanced Archetypes</h4>
      <p>
        An adventure may need more capable starting characters. Sometimes,
        players create a new character in an ongoing game. Some characters have
        enough experience and may have access to advanced archetypes. These are
        more capable or powerful character concepts. Advanced archetypes have
        distinct abilities and statuses for an adventure. A player may select an
        advanced archetype with the Game Master's (GM's) permission. The GM may
        have introduced the archetypes during the game or as an option after a
        character legacy. Characters often learn about these advanced archetypes
        through the story. The characters may have met a member or discovered
        information about these groups. The following Advanced Archetypes cannot
        be selected until Legendary talents have been introduced to a campaign.
        The Game Master may allow this archetype. A player must spend six
        experiences during character creation to choose one of these archetypes.
