    <h1>Core Rules of the Base6 Blueprint</h1>
    <p>
      This chapter covers the core rules of Light Omens RPG. These rules are the
      foundation of the game referenced throughout the text to navigate scenes,
      resolve actions, and shape narratives.
    </p>

    <h2>Scenes and Truths</h2>
    <p>
      A scene is the basic building block of any adventure. Shows, movies, and
      books also summarize these continuous action sequences. Scenes set the
      structure of Light Omens RPG. Each scene may cover a few minutes of an
      event up to an hour or so. The scene focuses on characters trying to
      achieve a goal or overcome a problem.
    </p>
    <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
    <p>
      A scene begins with the Game Master (GM) explaining the situation. Scenes
      include where the characters are, what’s happening, and anything worth
      knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene only exists because the characters need to be there. The player
      characters (PCs) may ask questions about the situation to act on. The GM
      responds with location details or non-player character (NPC) actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scene concludes when characters complete their intention or gain a new
      goal. A new scene begins immediately after one has finished and follows
      the narrative.
    </p>

    <h4>Define a Scene</h4>
    <p>
      The location, events occurring at specific times, and the people around
      define a scene. These facts influence the actions that characters want to
      and can try. Truths describe these facts in Light Omens RPG.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Truth is a key descriptor used for a person, place, or thing that can
      affect the scene for better or worse. Truths stand for significant facts
      about what is essential and clear in a scene. Most of the time, these are
      adjectives + a noun.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a Truth becomes insignificant to the scene description, it’s no longer
      a Truth.
    </p>
    <h3>Truths: The Pillars of Narrative</h3>
    <p>
      Truths help a GM judge what is and what isn’t possible. Truths help decide
      how difficult an action might be to try. They aid players in imagining
      situations and how to interact with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truths have no specific or exact duration. They exist as long as they
      stand for something true. The GM assigns whatever truths they feel are
      relevant to the circumstances of a scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM should be open to this process. Players may suggest Truths at the
      start of a scene. The GM and players may change Truths as the scene
      unfolds.
    </p>
    <h4>Types of Truths</h4>
    <p>
      The following Truth categories are for the GM but helpful to everyone at
      the table.
    </p>
    <table>
      Types of Truths
      <thead>
        <th>Truth Type</th>
        <th>Truth Description</th>
        <th>Truth Examples</th>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Location Truth</td>
        <td>
          These Truths describe a fact or detail about the location. These
          Truths exist as long as the location does. Location Truths affect
          characters when they interact with the environment.
        </td>
        <td>City Street, Coal Mine, or Dense Forest</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Situation Truth</td>
        <td>
          These Truths describe something happening in a scene. These Truths
          affect everyone involved, though character actions could alter these
          situations.
        </td>
        <td>
          Darkness, Heavy Rain, Thick Fog, Snow, Bustling Crowds, or Heavy
          Traffic
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Personal Truth</td>
        <td>
          These Truths describe the nature or state of a character or creature.
          These Truths express the innate or permanent quality of a character.
          They also stand for a changeable detail like mood, emotion, or injury.
        </td>
        <td>
          Aristocrat, Criminal, Greedy, Selfless, Blind, Tall, Sleeping, or
          Distracted
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Equipment Truth</td>
        <td>
          These Truths describe a single item, object, or tool. They exist so
          long as the item functions. Characters may pass the equipment and
          Truth as desired.
        </td>
        <td>
          Rifle, Sword, Helmet, Shield, Crowbar, Makeup Kit, Truck, or Car
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h4>Using Truths</h4>
    <p>
      Truths create a shared understanding of the scene, influencing character
      actions, potential outcomes, and narrative progression.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Beneficial Truths can lower the Difficulty of actions, make impossible
        tasks feasible, or outright remove the need for a Test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detrimental Truths increase the Difficulty of actions, add
        complications, or prevent certain actions altogether.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The GM and players collaborate to establish and adapt Truths. Players may
      propose new Truths or suggest adjustments as their actions reshape the
      environment or their circumstances.
    </p>
    <h4>Permission and Difficulty</h4>
    <p>
      Truths are more than descriptive notes. The effect of a Truth helps a GM
      decide how easy or challenging something is to achieve. Truths may help
      decide what is and what isn’t possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the location is [location Truth]... / Because the situation is
      [situation Truth]... / Because the character is [personal Truth]... /
      Because the character has [equipment Truth]...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ...the action is possible. The Truth allows the character to try the
        action.
      </li>
      <li>
        ...the action is easier. The Truth reduces the Difficulty of the Test to
        try the action.
      </li>
      <li>
        ...the action is harder. The Truth increases the Difficulty fo the Test
        to try the action.
      </li>
      <li>
        ...the action is impossible. The Truth prevents the character from
        trying the action.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sometimes, a Truth has no impact on the action and has no effect. Not all
      Truths are relevant all the time. Truths with a particularly potent effect
      should become several identical Truths. Identical Truths create a single
      Truth that expresses the potency. The number after the name of a Truth
      stands for the multiplication of said Truth.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Situations: Scenes and Truths in Action</h3>
    <p>Pending</p>

    <h2>Action Tests</h2>
    <p>
      Characters in Light Omens overcome challenges with enough time or
      resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      An action occurs when an activity has the potential to succeed or fail. A
      Test is a mechanic the Game Master (GM) uses when a player character (PC)
      desires to do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM decides whether the character can achieve the intended goal.
      Possibilities may change based on the current situations and relevant
      Truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      A GM examines the action asked. Can the character do it without
      struggling?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No Test Needed. The action is routine or impossible in the
        circumstances. Walking through an open doorway (routine) or tying to
        lift a mountain with bare hands (impossible).
      </li>
      <li>
        Test Required. The action's outcome is uncertain, requiring effort,
        overcoming resitance, or has a chance to fail. Picking a lock under
        pressure or leaping across a chasm during an earthquake.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Anything is Possible. No doesn't mean no forever. It simply means that a
      character can't do a task right now. It means a character must discover
      how to make it happen. A character can succeed at just about anything they
      set their mind to. Given sufficient time, the correct tools, and the
      opportunity to concentrate.
    </p>

    <h3>Risk Assesment</h3>
    <p>
      The Game Master (GM) should know what a Test is for, and the consequences
      involved. A character wanting to achieve something has simple or complex
      consequences.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Achieve something simple. A character gets what they want on a success.
        A character doesn’t get what they want on a failure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Achieve something complex. A character gets what they want and avoids
        the consequences with success. A character doesn’t get what they want
        and suffers the consequences of failure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The GM should inform players of the potential outcomes before they try a
      Test. Giving this information isn’t considered “metagaming.” Player
      characters (PCs) have enough experience to understand the results of their
      actions.
    </p>

    <h3>Conducting a Test</h3>
    <p>
      A Test involves rolling several dice and following a specific process.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        First, Action Requirements. The Game Master (GM) chooses the applicable
        Attribute and Approach. This combination is either provided by the rules
        of the text or suggested by the player. The GM has the final say. Rules
        may list Attribute (Approach) in the text for reference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second, Action Difficulty. The GM sets the Difficulty of the Test. This
        number falls between 0 – 5, with extreme cases going higher. Truths may
        increase or decrease the Difficulty. A player must generate a number of
        successes equal to or greater than the Difficulty to pass the Test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third, Player Dice Pool. The player gathers their dice pool of d6s equal
        to their Attribute and Approach values. The player may upgrade any d6s
        in the dice pool up to their Approach value by spending Hope (explained
        later).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth, Counting Successes. Each dice that rolls equal to or greater
        than six scores a single success. Each dice that rolls double digits
        (10, 11, or 12) instead scores two successes. Each dice that rolls a 1
        causes a Complication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fifth, Test Results. The Test is successful when the number of successes
        equals or exceeds the Difficulty of the Test. If the number of successes
        scored is less than the Difficulty of the Test, then the Test has
        failed. Each success above the Difficulty becomes a single point of
        Harmony (explained later).
      </li>
      <li>
        Sixth, Action Outcome. The GM describes the outcome of the Test. The
        player may spend Harmony to improve the results of a successful Test.
        Complications take effect after the outcome of the Test is resolved.
      </li>
    </ol>

    </table>

    <h3>Difficulty</h3>
    <p>
      The Difficulty is the number of successes necessary to pass a Test. The
      Game Master (GM) declares the Difficulty when calling for Test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Tests have a base Difficulty of 1 unless otherwise noted. A
      straightforward Test may have a Difficulty of 0. More complex or
      problematic Tests may have a higher Difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players should know the Difficulty of the Tests they try. This knowledge
      allows players to decide what they must do for the best chance of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM considers any factors in the scene that affect the Test. These
      factors come in the form of Truths. Truths either have no impact or one of
      the following effects.
