    <h1>Core Rules of the Base6 Blueprint</h1>
    <p>
      This chapter covers the core rules of Light Omens RPG. These rules are the
      foundation of the game referenced throughout the text to navigate scenes,
      resolve actions, and shape narratives.
    </p>

    <h2>Scenes and Truths</h2>
    <p>
      A scene is the basic building block of any adventure. Shows, movies, and
      books also summarize these continuous action sequences. Scenes set the
      structure of Light Omens RPG. Each scene may cover a few minutes of an
      event up to an hour or so. The scene focuses on characters trying to
      achieve a goal or overcome a problem.
    </p>
    <h3>Setting the Scene</h3>
    <p>
      A scene begins with the Game Master (GM) explaining the situation. Scenes
      include where the characters are, what’s happening, and anything worth
      knowing.
    </p>
    <p>
      The scene only exists because the characters need to be there. The player
      characters (PCs) may ask questions about the situation to act on. The GM
      responds with location details or non-player character (NPC) actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      A scene concludes when characters complete their intention or gain a new
      goal. A new scene begins immediately after one has finished and follows
      the narrative.
    </p>

    <h4>Define a Scene</h4>
    <p>
      The location, events occurring at specific times, and the people around
      define a scene. These facts influence the actions that characters want to
      and can try. Truths describe these facts in Light Omens RPG.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Truth is a key descriptor used for a person, place, or thing that can
      affect the scene for better or worse. Truths stand for significant facts
      about what is essential and clear in a scene. Most of the time, these are
      adjectives + a noun.
    </p>
    <p>
      If a Truth becomes insignificant to the scene description, it’s no longer
      a Truth.
    </p>
    <h3>Truths: The Pillars of Narrative</h3>
    <p>
      Truths help a GM judge what is and what isn’t possible. Truths help decide
      how difficult an action might be to try. They aid players in imagining
      situations and how to interact with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truths have no specific or exact duration. They exist as long as they
      stand for something true. The GM assigns whatever truths they feel are
      relevant to the circumstances of a scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM should be open to this process. Players may suggest Truths at the
      start of a scene. The GM and players may change Truths as the scene
      unfolds.
    </p>
    <h4>Types of Truths</h4>
    <p>
      The following Truth categories are for the GM but helpful to everyone at
      the table.
    </p>
    <table>
      Types of Truths
      <thead>
        <th>Truth Type</th>
        <th>Truth Description</th>
        <th>Truth Examples</th>
      </thead>
      <tr>
        <td>Location Truth</td>
        <td>
          These Truths describe a fact or detail about the location. These
          Truths exist as long as the location does. Location Truths affect
          characters when they interact with the environment.
        </td>
        <td>City Street, Coal Mine, or Dense Forest</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Situation Truth</td>
        <td>
          These Truths describe something happening in a scene. These Truths
          affect everyone involved, though character actions could alter these
          situations.
        </td>
        <td>
          Darkness, Heavy Rain, Thick Fog, Snow, Bustling Crowds, or Heavy
          Traffic
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Personal Truth</td>
        <td>
          These Truths describe the nature or state of a character or creature.
          These Truths express the innate or permanent quality of a character.
          They also stand for a changeable detail like mood, emotion, or injury.
        </td>
        <td>
          Aristocrat, Criminal, Greedy, Selfless, Blind, Tall, Sleeping, or
          Distracted
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Equipment Truth</td>
        <td>
          These Truths describe a single item, object, or tool. They exist so
          long as the item functions. Characters may pass the equipment and
          Truth as desired.
        </td>
        <td>
          Rifle, Sword, Helmet, Shield, Crowbar, Makeup Kit, Truck, or Car
        </td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <h4>Using Truths</h4>
    <p>
      Truths create a shared understanding of the scene, influencing character
      actions, potential outcomes, and narrative progression.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Beneficial Truths can lower the Difficulty of actions, make impossible
        tasks feasible, or outright remove the need for a Test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Detrimental Truths increase the Difficulty of actions, add
        complications, or prevent certain actions altogether.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The GM and players collaborate to establish and adapt Truths. Players may
      propose new Truths or suggest adjustments as their actions reshape the
      environment or their circumstances.
    </p>
    <h4>Permission and Difficulty</h4>
    <p>
      Truths are more than descriptive notes. The effect of a Truth helps a GM
      decide how easy or challenging something is to achieve. Truths may help
      decide what is and what isn’t possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because the location is [location Truth]... / Because the situation is
      [situation Truth]... / Because the character is [personal Truth]... /
      Because the character has [equipment Truth]...
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        ...the action is possible. The Truth allows the character to try the
        action.
      </li>
      <li>
        ...the action is easier. The Truth reduces the Difficulty of the Test to
        try the action.
      </li>
      <li>
        ...the action is harder. The Truth increases the Difficulty fo the Test
        to try the action.
      </li>
      <li>
        ...the action is impossible. The Truth prevents the character from
        trying the action.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Sometimes, a Truth has no impact on the action and has no effect. Not all
      Truths are relevant all the time. Truths with a particularly potent effect
      should become several identical Truths. Identical Truths create a single
      Truth that expresses the potency. The number after the name of a Truth
      stands for the multiplication of said Truth.
    </p>

    <h3>Example Situations: Scenes and Truths in Action</h3>
    <p>Pending</p>

    <h2>Action Tests</h2>
    <p>
      Characters in Light Omens overcome challenges with enough time or
      resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      An action occurs when an activity has the potential to succeed or fail. A
      Test is a mechanic the Game Master (GM) uses when a player character (PC)
      desires to do something.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM decides whether the character can achieve the intended goal.
      Possibilities may change based on the current situations and relevant
      Truths.
    </p>
    <p>
      A GM examines the action asked. Can the character do it without
      struggling?
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        No Test Needed. The action is routine or impossible in the
        circumstances. Walking through an open doorway (routine) or tying to
        lift a mountain with bare hands (impossible).
      </li>
      <li>
        Test Required. The action's outcome is uncertain, requiring effort,
        overcoming resitance, or has a chance to fail. Picking a lock under
        pressure or leaping across a chasm during an earthquake.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Anything is Possible. No doesn't mean no forever. It simply means that a
      character can't do a task right now. It means a character must discover
      how to make it happen. A character can succeed at just about anything they
      set their mind to. Given sufficient time, the correct tools, and the
      opportunity to concentrate.
    </p>

    <h3>Risk Assesment</h3>
    <p>
      The Game Master (GM) should know what a Test is for, and the consequences
      involved. A character wanting to achieve something has simple or complex
      consequences.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Achieve something simple. A character gets what they want on a success.
        A character doesn’t get what they want on a failure.
      </li>
      <li>
        Achieve something complex. A character gets what they want and avoids
        the consequences with success. A character doesn’t get what they want
        and suffers the consequences of failure.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      The GM should inform players of the potential outcomes before they try a
      Test. Giving this information isn’t considered “metagaming.” Player
      characters (PCs) have enough experience to understand the results of their
      actions.
    </p>

    <h3>Conducting a Test</h3>
    <p>
      A Test involves rolling several dice and following a specific process.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        First, Action Requirements. The Game Master (GM) chooses the applicable
        Attribute and Approach. This combination is either provided by the rules
        of the text or suggested by the player. The GM has the final say. Rules
        may list Attribute (Approach) in the text for reference.
      </li>
      <li>
        Second, Action Difficulty. The GM sets the Difficulty of the Test. This
        number falls between 0 – 5, with extreme cases going higher. Truths may
        increase or decrease the Difficulty. A player must generate a number of
        successes equal to or greater than the Difficulty to pass the Test.
      </li>
      <li>
        Third, Player Dice Pool. The player gathers their dice pool of d6s equal
        to their Attribute and Approach values. The player may upgrade any d6s
        in the dice pool up to their Approach value by spending Hope (explained
        later).
      </li>
      <li>
        Fourth, Counting Successes. Each dice that rolls equal to or greater
        than six scores a single success. Each dice that rolls double digits
        (10, 11, or 12) instead scores two successes. Each dice that rolls a 1
        causes a Complication.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fifth, Test Results. The Test is successful when the number of successes
        equals or exceeds the Difficulty of the Test. If the number of successes
        scored is less than the Difficulty of the Test, then the Test has
        failed. Each success above the Difficulty becomes a single point of
        Momentum (explained later).
      </li>
      <li>
        Sixth, Action Outcome. The GM describes the outcome of the Test. The
        player may spend Momentum to improve the results of a successful Test.
        Complications take effect after the outcome of the Test is resolved.
      </li>
    </ol>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>Difficulty and Outcomes</h3>
    <p>
      The Difficulty is the number of successes necessary to pass a Test. The
      Game Master (GM) declares the Difficulty when calling for Test.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most Tests have a base Difficulty of 1 unless otherwise noted. A
      straightforward Test may have a Difficulty of 0. More complex or
      problematic Tests may have a higher Difficulty.
    </p>
    <p>
      Players should know the Difficulty of the Tests they try. This knowledge
      allows players to decide what they must do for the best chance of success.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM considers any factors in the scene that affect the Test. These
      factors come in the form of Truths. Truths either have no impact or one of
      the following effects.
    </p>

        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h4>Routine Tests (Zero Difficulty)</h4>
    <p>
      Certain circumstances can reduce the Difficulty of a Test to zero.
      Sometimes, a Test may be so routine that it doesn’t need a dice roll. If
      an action has a Difficulty of 0, it is successful and does not need a dice
      roll. Successful actions have no risk of Complications. They also can’t
      generate Momentum nor spend Momentum on the outcome. The GM may allow a
      character to roll against a Difficulty 0 Test and generate Momentum. Every
      success generates Momentum since the Test requires zero success. But
      rolling comes with the risk of Complications.
    </p>

    <h4>Simple Tests (Difficulty Of 1)</h4>
    <p>
      A Simple Test is an action that requires at least one generated success to
      pass. A Simple Test poses little challenge to most characters that work
      their strengths. Something could still go wrong, and failure still is
      possible. We assume characters have proper training and expect success
      with most Simple Tests.
    </p>

    <h4>Average Tests (Difficulty Of 2)</h4>
    <p>
      An Average Test is an action that requires at least two generated
      successes to pass. An Average Test stands for uncommon actions where
      success requires preparation. A hopeful character is more likely to
      succeed in this task than most. The risk of failure still lingers without
      adequate planning or training.
    </p>

    <h4>Challenging Tests (Difficulty Of 3)</h4>
    <p>
      A Challenging Test is an action that requires at least three generated
      successes to pass. Attempting a Test at this difficulty or higher grants
      the character one experience. Characters will find a Challenging Test more
      difficult than most tasks. Without luck or a team on their side, failure
      is more likely than success. Better equipment, competent allies, and
      careful planning increase the odds of success. Complications are more
      likely than success at this point.
    </p>

    <h4>Daunting Tests (Difficulty Of 4)</h4>
    <p>
      A Daunting Test is an action that requires at least four generated
      successes to pass. A Daunting Test pushes a character to its limits. Even
      adequate training, tools, resources, and support are likely to fail such a
      Test than pass. The most hopeful can try these actions but not without
      several complications.
    </p>

    <h4>Formidable Tests (Difficulty Of 5)</h4>
    <p>
      A Formidable Test is an action that requires at least five generated
      successes to pass. A Formidable Test is shy of impossible. Without
      dedicated training, resources, and tools, there is little chance of
      success. Attempting such an action is still likely to make anyone
      hopeless.
    </p>

    <h3>Complications and Risks</h3>
    <p>
      Complications occur when any dice rolls a “1” during a Test. Complications
      arise after a Test resolves and the Game Master (GM) provides the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Complications may cause problems but don’t prevent a successful Test.
      Complications manifest as Truths or Chaos (explained later).
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM may use a Complication to inflict a Truth on the character based on
      the action. Negative Truths may increase the Difficulty of following Tests
      or make them impossible.
    </p>
    <p>The player or GM may negate the Complication by generating one Chaos.</p>

    <h4>Complication Range</h4>
    <p>
      Circumstances may increase the risk of a Complication of a Test. These
      circumstances increase the complication range for player characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Increasing the complication range by one means a Complication occurs for
      each dice that rolls 1s or 2s. Increasing the complication range by two
      means complications occur on 1s, 2s, or 3s. The complication range is
      equal to the Difficulty of the Test.
    </p>
    <p>The following table summarizes complication ranges.</p>
    <table>
      Complication Ranges
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>Complication Range</th>
          <th>Complications Triggered on…</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>1</td>
          <td>Rolls of 1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>2</td>
          <td>Rolls of 1 or 2</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>3</td>
          <td>Rolls of 1, 2, or 3</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>4</td>
          <td>Rolls of 1, 2, 3, or 4</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>5</td>
          <td>Rolls of 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5</td>
        </tr>
      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h4>Complicated Success</h4>
    <p>
      The GM may allow characters to succeed with a price before a Test or after
      they roll. This possibility allows a successful Test while the character
      suffers one Complication. This complication adds to any that occurs
      because of the dice roll.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters can't spend Momentum on the outcome of a Test with Complicated
      Success. The GM can cause the character to suffer several complications on
      the Test. Players should be aware of the number of complications possible
      with this possibility.
    </p>
    <h3>Collaboration and Contests</h3>
    <p>Teamwork and opposition bring dynamic interactions into gameplay:</p>
    <h4>Assistance</h4>
    <p>
      Several characters can work together when trying a Test. One character is
      the leader, and the remaining are assistants.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Game Master (GM) decides whether a character can assist and whether
      any limitations apply. Limitations or penalties may create negative Truths
      or increase the complication range.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assistants describe how they help the leader using a specific Attribute
      and Approach. The player then rolls 1d12 with the GM’s permission. An
      assistant provides any earned successes to the leader’s result. Assisting
      characters may generate Complications as normal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Assistants may only roll one d12 while assisting. They may not spend Hope
      to upgrade dice but may spend Hope to reroll as normal.
    </p>

    <h4>Contests</h4>
    <p>
      Characters face more challenges than obstacles in their path. Characters
      may try to beat an opponent. These situations call for a Contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      A Contest has one character attempting to do something while opposed by
      another. These are active and reactive characters. If more characters are
      on each side of a Contest, each one acts as an assistant.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        First. The reactive character rolls without a Difficulty to beat. The
        number of successes scored becomes the Difficulty for the active
        character.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then. The active character makes a Test to beat the Difficulty set for
        them.
      </li>
      <li>
        Active Character Success. The active character achieves their goal and
        generates Momentum on a success.
      </li>
      <li>
        Active Character Failure. The active character doesn’t achieve their
        goal. The reactive character generates Momentum for each success below
        the Difficulty set.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <table>
      <thead>
        <tr>
          <th>The Active Character</th>
          <th>The Reactive Character</th>
        </tr>
      </thead>
      <tbody>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Has an easier test. Reduce the reactive character's total success by
            -1.
          </td>
          <td>
            Has an easier test. Increase the reactive character's total success
            by +1.
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td>
            Has a harder test. Increase the reactive character's total success
            by +1.
          </td>
          <td>
            Has a harder test. Reduce the reactive character's total success by

    </table>
    <h2>Momentum and Chaos: Shared and Personal Pools</h2>
    <p>
      Characters share a Momentum Pool for group efforts, capped at six points.
      Similarly, the GM's Chaos Pool grows or diminishes based on player actions
      and narrative needs.
    </p>
    <h3>Momentum: The Player's Resource</h3>
    <p>
      Successes that exceed the Difficulty of a Test become Momentum. Momentum
      allows characters to complete an action faster, better, or with more
      benefits.
    </p>
    <p>
      Each success beyond the Difficulty of a Test becomes a single point of
      Momentum. A character may use this earned Momentum at once or save it for
      later.
    </p>
    <h4>Saving Momentum</h4>
    <p>
      Characters can save their unspent Momentum rather than letting it go to
      waste. Any Momentum saved adds to a group pool for the player characters.
      Any character in the group may use the Momentum from this pool, enhancing
      teamwork. The group pool cannot hold more than six Harmonies.
    </p>
    <p>
      When group members want to spend Momentum, they may spend from their earn
      pool or the group pool. One point of Momentum drains from the pool at the
      end of every scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      Adversaries don’t have a Momentum pool like player characters. Instead,
      they interact with the Chaos pool.
    </p>
    <h4>Spending Momentum</h4>
    <p>Momentum offers a way to improve the outcome of a successful Test.</p>
    <p>
      Once the Game Master (GM) decides the success of a Test, they describe the
      outcome. Players may then spend earned Momentum to improve the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Momentum used to improve the outcome doesn’t need declaration in advance.
      Momentum allows a character to spend one at a time as desired.
    </p>
    <p>
      Uses of Momentum can only apply once on any given Test or once (by each
      character) in any given round of conflict. Some uses of Momentum allow
      repeated uses noted as “per Momentum spent” or repeatable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Once a character’s Test resolves, any unspent Momentum adds to the group’s
      pool. If the pool is full, the gained Momentum disappears.
    </p>

    <h3>Chaos: The GM's Resource</h3>
    <p>
      The Game Master (GM) has Chaos while player characters interact with
      Harmony. Chaos allows the GM to alter scenes, empower adversaries, and
      enhance challenges. The GM gains Chaos throughout the game like the
      players gain Harmony.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chaos is a tangible “cause and effect” for the GM. The increase and
      reduction of the Chaos pool links to actions and consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM begins each adventure with one Chaos per player character. The tone
      of the adventure can adjust the starting Chaos. High-stakes adventures may
      provide more Chaos per player character. Calm situations may start with
      little to no Chaos.
    </p>
    <h4>Generating Chaos</h4>
    <p>Chaos is earned during gameplay through various means:</p>

        <tr>
          <td>Chaotic Circumstances</td>
          <td>Varies</td>
          <td>

      </tbody>
    </table>
    <h4>Spending Chaos</h4>
    <p>
      The GM can spend Chaos to create tension, enhance NPCs, or alter the
      environment:

    <h2>Hope: Fuel for Heroism</h2>
    <p>
      Player characters have access to a personal resource called Hope. Hope
      represents the resilience, determination, and sheer willpower of a
      character. It’s more than a mechanical resource; it’s a measure of what
      makes heroes extraordinary in Light Omens RPG.
    </p>
    <p>
      Characters draw on Hope to accomplish daring feats, defy the odds, and
      protect themselves from harm. But Hope is finite, and when it runs out,
      characters risk becoming Hopeless, in a state of vulnerability and
      desperation.
