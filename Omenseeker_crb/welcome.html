    <h1>Welcome to Light Omens</h1>

    <p>
      Welcome to the mysterious realm of Light Omens, where light and shadow
      intertwine, forging destinies and reshaping the world of Hiraeth. A land
      reclaimed from the tyranny of primeval forces, Hiraeth bears the scars of
      its tumultuous past. Wars have been waged, empires have been toppled, and
      the mighty energy of the Grim Light has forever altered its fate.
    </p>

    <p>
      Hiraeth was once a battlefield dominated by dragons, giants, and elemental
      forces that enslaved humanity. The arrival of the Grim Light shattered
      that cycle, empowering the Erathans to rise as heroes and liberators. Yet,
      their victory came at a cost: the world remains fractured, its peace
      fragile, and its lands haunted by both the remnants of its oppressors and
      the unintended consequences of its salvation.
    </p>

    <p>
      For Seekers like you, Hiraeth is a canvas painted with hidden truths,
      untamed power, and the faint but unyielding glimmer of hope. Its
      landscapes tell stories of towering cities humming with latent energy,
      wild frontiers marked by mystery, and ruins whispering ancient
      civilizations' secrets. Every corner of Hiraeth holds a challenge, and
      every shadow hides a choice. Will you seek out the relics of the Grim
      Forges, navigate the volatile alliances of warring factions, or carve your
      legend in the untamed wilds, claiming your place in a history still being
      written?
    </p>

    <h2>Themes of Light and Shadow</h2>
    <p>
      At the heart of Light Omens lies the eternal tension between two forces:
      the radiant promise of light and the insidious pull of shadow. The Grim
      Light, the world’s defining power source, is a beacon of hope and a
      reminder of sacrifice. It offers immense potential to those who wield it,
      but its allure comes with personal, societal, and moral costs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Shadows, meanwhile, are ever-present. They are not just literal darkness
      but symbols of every heart's fears, doubts, and ambitions. They are the
      lingering echoes of the Everlasting Night and the forces threatening to
      reclaim the light. For the people of Hiraeth, shadows are both external
      forces and internal struggles, shaping lives and testing wills.
    </p>

    <p>
      As a player, you will navigate this duality. Will you embrace the power of
      the Grim Light, knowing it may change you forever? Will you resist the
      shadows or find a way to understand and wield their strength? Every
      decision shapes your character and the evolving world. This interplay of
      light and shadow forms the core of your journey, offering depth and moral
      complexity at every turn.
    </p>

    <h3>Hope Punk vs. Grim Dark: The Emotional Landscape</h3>
    <p>
      In Light Omens, the narrative tone exists on a spectrum, blending the
      optimistic determination of Hope Punk with the gritty realism of Grim
      Dark. The opposing perspectives enrich the storytelling experience,
      allowing for moments of triumph amidst despair.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Hope Punk celebrates defiance in the face of darkness. It thrives on the
        belief that collective action, compassion, and persistence can
        illuminate even the bleakest circumstances. In this light, Seekers build
        bridges across divides, rekindle lost connections, and strive to leave
        the world better than they found it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Grim Dark, by contrast, reveals the weight of survival in a world where
        power corrupts and hope is a fragile flame. It asks difficult questions:
        What are you willing to sacrifice? How do you confront the inevitability
        of loss? Grim Dark moments challenge players with the moral ambiguity of
        their choices, enriching the story’s complexity.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Playing as a Seeker: A Primer on Adventure</h2>
    <p>
      Seekers are the lifeblood of Hiraeth, intrepid adventurers who confront
      the unknown and seek meaning in a world of chaos. Whether you are a
      scavenger in the ruins of the Grim Forges, a diplomat navigating the
      volatile alliances of the Revenites or Technocrats, or a warrior defending
      your people from the encroaching darkness, your journey shapes the world
      around you.
    </p>
    <p>Seekers are defined not by a single purpose but by their motivations:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Some pursue the Grim Light’s mysteries, drawn by its whispers of untold
        power.
      </li>
      <li>
        Others seek to safeguard their communities, using knowledge, diplomacy,
        or strength to build a brighter future.
      </li>
      <li>
        Yet others are driven by ambition, hunting for relics and resources to
        claim their mark on the shifting sands of history.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Whatever your goal, as a Seeker, you are not merely an observer of history
      but an author. Each choice you make, each ally you gain, and each truth
      you uncover builds your legend, influencing the fate of Hiraeth itself.
    </p>

    <h3>Your Path as a Seeker</h3>
    <p>
      As a Seeker, your journey is shaped by the paths you choose and the
      actions you take. These are some of the defining avenues you may explore:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Discover Lost Knowledge. Unearth the secrets of the Grim Forges, Ark
        Rifts, and ancient civilizations. Every text, relic, and memory holds
        the potential to reshape your understanding of the world and your role
        in it.
      </li>
      <li>
        Forge Alliances. Align yourself with factions such as the Aethernauts,
        Revenites, or Erathans, or carve your independent path. Your choices
        will determine your allies, enemies, and influence in the fractured
        political landscape.
      </li>
      <li>
        Master the Grim Light. Harness the transformative power of this mighty
        energy. Forge weapons, summon latent forces, or manipulate the elements
        to overcome adversity.
      </li>
      <li>
        Shape Your Legend. Use your character’s origins, archetypes, and
        tendencies to craft your story. Your Seeker is not just a character on a
        page; they embody aspirations, flaws, and dreams.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The Seeker's Tools</h3>
    <p>
      Every Seeker has physical and conceptual tools that define their approach
      to challenges and triumphs.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Truths. Narrative elements that shape the world of its events. Personal,
        situational, and environmental truths provide opportunities and
        obstacles, allowing players to interact dynamically with their
        surroundings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Momentum and Chaos. These resources balance calculated risk and
        collective success. Use Momentum to inspire allies and shape favorable
        outcomes; embrace Chaos to confront danger and defy the odds.
      </li>
      <li>
        Hope. The most personal and vital resource, Hope, represents your
        character’s resilience and determination. The spark keeps the light
        alive in the face of overwhelming odds.
      </li>
    </ul>
