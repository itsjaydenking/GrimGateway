    <h1>Conflict and Combat</h1>
    <p>
      An adventure or session of Light Omens RPG breaks into scenes, like a
      novel, TV show, movie, or other story. A loose structure like this is
      ideal for many situations during the game. Conflict scenes have evolving
      situations, and the actions carry higher stakes. Structure helps manage
      conflict scenes and the many moving pieces.
    </p>
    <h2>Action Order</h2>
    <p>
      The Game Master (GM) chooses who acts first, then who acts next, and so
      forth. Giving the GM direct control allows them to move the scene based on
      what’s most fitting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or the conflict scene may use an action order. Rounds and Turns divide the
      action of a conflict scene. Each character or group of NPCs gets a single
      turn. The round ends once everyone has taken one turn, and the next round
      begins.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM selects the first character to act at the start of the scene. The
      controlling player selects one other character who hasn't taken a turn
      that round. The chosen character takes their turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      The last character to have a turn on a round may select any character,
      including themselves. The chosen character takes the first turn of the
      following round.
    </p>
    <p>
      Any character that hasn't acted during a round may interrupt the action
      order. The character must spend one Momentum or two Chaos for NPCs. That
      character takes their turn instead.
    </p>
    <h2>Movement and Zones</h2>
    <p>
      Tracking positions can be vital in conflict. Deciding where you are and
      how far something is remains helpful.
    </p>
    <p>
      The environment of an action scene is the “battlefield.” Game Master (GM)
      divides the location into several abstract zones. Each zone stands for a
      specific area within the location.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character may move up to one zone in any direction before, after, or as
      part of the action they take during their turn. The character may move one
      extra zone on the same turn. The character must spend one Momentum or add
      +1 to the Difficulty of any Test taken for their action.
    </p>
    <h3>Moving and Grooving</h3>
    <p>
      A zone with difficult terrain or with obstacles blocking access includes
      more challenges. The character must spend Momentum or pass a Test to
      complete their movement. The GM decides the amount of Momentum or
      Difficulty of the Test needed to pass.
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Melee Attacks. A character may try a melee attack against any target in
        the same zone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Ranged Attacks. A character may try a ranged attack against any target
        they can see. Attempting an attack against a target in the same zone or
        adjacent zone comes with no penalty. Targets further than an adjacent
        zone increase the challenge of the attempted attack. The character adds
        +1 to the Difficulty of the attack for each extra zone between them.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Actions</h2>
    <p>
      Character actions fall into one of a few broad categories in this game.
      This applies to non-player characters as much as player characters. The
      characters perform four broad actions:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Advance and Attack. The action intends to move forward by way of force
        or finesse. The goal is to harm or otherwise defeat a given target. Such
        an action cannot be undone.
      </li>
      <li>
        Evade and Endure. The action intends to hold a position relying on
        finesse or focus. The goal is to resist some potential danger or
        unfortunate action or event. This action avoids the effects of others
        but not of oneself.
      </li>
      <li>
        Improvise and Interact. The action intends to overcome a challenge by
        any means available. The goal is to achieve something other than
        inflicting or repelling harm.
      </li>
      <li>
        Plan and Prepare. The action intends to change the circumstances of the
        given scene. The goal is to change an active Truth or introduce a new
        Truth to the scene.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Advance and Attack</h3>
    <p>
      This action is for all the methods of attack that a character may have
      against a target. This offensive action requires either a Test or a
      Contest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attempt is a Contest if the target can defend themselves and is a Test
      if the target cannot.
    </p>
    <p>
      Melee attacks need the target to be within reach of the weapon. Ranged
      attacks need a line of sight on the target. Whether the attack is melee or
      ranged depends on the weapon's type and use.
    </p>
    <p>
      The GM sets the Difficulty of the Test with a base Difficulty of 1 for
      melee attacks and 2 for ranged attacks. The target suffers an Injury if
      the attack succeeds. Some characters become defeated after suffering an
      Injury.
    </p>
    <h4>Counters</h4>
    <p>
      A character that succeeds in defending against an attack may use a
      counter. The character may spend two points of Momentum and inflict Injury
      as if they had made a successful attack.
    </p>
    <h3>Evade and Endure</h3>
    <p>
      This action describes events with an opportunity to respond to danger.
      This defensive action applies to incoming hazards and not attacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      The player describes how they are avoiding or surviving the impending
      danger. The character must succeed in a Test to avoid the danger or
      suffering the consequences of a failure.
    </p>
    <h3>Improvise and Interact</h3>
    <p>
      This flexible choice covers any action not considered offensive or
      defensive yet dangerous.
    </p>
    <p>
      The player describes the goal that the character is trying to achieve. The
      GM decides whether the goal is achievable and requires a Test. Success on
      the Test allows the character to achieve the goal; failure means they
      don’t.
    </p>

    <h3>Plan and Prepare</h3>
    <p>
      The character attempts to define a fundamental fact of the situation. This
      creates a new Truth, removes a Truth, or changes a Truth.
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal must be possible for the character to affect the desired change.
      Truths stand for physical, mental, or social advantages or setbacks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Attempting this action requires a base Difficulty 2 Test. Success creates,
      removes, or changes the Truth as desired. Failure may mean the Truth is
      not defined, and consequences occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Truths have no set duration and remain as long as they stay true. Some
      truths may last for a single action, while others remain until removed or
      changed.
    </p>
    <h2>Injuries</h2>
    <p>
      During an action scene or conflict, a character may suffer Injury due to
      attacks or hazards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Injury is a specific type of Truth standing for a character's wounds and
      traumas. As with any Truth, they can affect the Difficulty of Tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      Weapons and hazards alike list a default type of Injury they inflict and a
      damage rating ranging from 1 to 6.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character may spend Momentum to increase the damage rating of a
      successful attack. Each Momentum spent adds +1 to the damage rating.
      Environmental effects may also inflict injuries. Unarmed attacks have a
      damage rating of 1 and Momentum cannot increase this.
    </p>

    <h3>Special Injuries</h3>
    <p>
      A character may experience different types of injuries other than physical
      injuries. Intimidation may scare someone, a riddle may confuse them, and
      even embarrassment occurs. There are moments when a hopeful speech breaks
      through the hard shell of a villain.
    </p>
    <p>
      In most cases, these injuries are non-lethal, meaning they recover at the
      end of the scene. Some may have a longer duration, following the normal
      rules for injury. In some cases, a character may face defeat from these
      injuries.
    </p>
    <p>
      A common one in this world is being so terrified that a character succumbs
      to total despair. This can be as bad as dying, if not worse. The Game
      Master determines the severity of mental and emotional injuries.
    </p>

    <h3>Avoiding Injuries</h3>
    <p>A character may spend Hope to avoid suffering Injury.</p>
    <p>
      A character must spend enough Hope equal to the damage rating of the
      attack. Hope spending occurs after any increases in the attacker's
      spending Momentum.
    </p>
    <p>
      Worn armor reduces the amount of Hope needed to spend by the protection
      rating. A character must spend at least one Hope to avoid Injury,
      regardless of the protection rating. NPCs spend Chaos rather than Hope to
      avoid injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character can sacrifice worn armor to avoid Injury. Doing so destroys
      the armor, and it provides no further protection. The character suffers no
      Injury but is still defeated.
    </p>

    <h4>Delaying the Inevitable</h4>
    <p>
      A character may spend whatever Hope they have left even if they do not
      have enough to match the damage rating. Doing so delays the Injury until
      the end of the scene rather than at once. NPCs cannot use this choice.
    </p>

    <h3>Injury and Defeat</h3>
    <p>
      When a character suffers an Injury, they are also defeated. A defeated
      character cannot act during the current scene. Defeat may represent
      unconsciousness, overwhelming pain, or a lack of energy. It always means a
      character is unable to take part in the scene.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character can bring back a defeated character into an active scene. Such
      an action is a Test with a Difficulty of 2. A character's method to return
      their companion determines the Attribute and Approach. Soul
      (Force/Finesse) are common choices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Removing the defeated state allows a character to act in the scene.
      Leaving the defeated state doesn't remove any Injuries, restore Hope, or
      prevent hopelessness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Most characters leave the defeated state at the end of the current scene.
    </p>

    <h3>Healing Injuries</h3>
    <p>
      A character suffering one or more Injuries requires healing. Injuries need
      more effort to recover than Hope alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tending to Injuries requires two stages: first aid and rehabilitation.
    </p>

    <h4>First Aid</h4>
    <p>
      First aid covers the immediate treatment of an Injury. First aid doesn’t
      remove a character’s Injury but rather changes the Injury to reflect
      treatment. Treated Injuries do not count as healed but are less of a
      hindrance.
    </p>
    <p>
      First aid requires a Test with a Difficulty equal to the base damage
      rating of the Injury. The base damage rating is the first rating before
      any extra from Momentum. Success treats the specific Injury.
    </p>
    <p>
      Treated Injuries are temporary Truths that circumstances may change. A
      character reverts their highest cost treated Injury after suffering any
      extra Injuries.
    </p>

    <h4>Rehabilitation</h4>
    <p>
      Rehabilitation is the primary method to remove an Injury once treated.
    </p>
    <p>
      A character must complete several Long rests to remove an Injury. The
      number of Long rests necessary equals twice the Injury's damage rating. A
      full day of rest counts as two Long rests for healing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Untreated Injuries do not heal this way. Each Long rest untreated
      increases the severity by +1 and generates one Chaos. The GM may spend
      Chaos to inflict Truths on a character who has left Injuries untreated.
    </p>

    <h3>Death and Despair</h3>
    <p>
      Characters face the end of their journey in the following ways. For
      example,
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        A defeated character dies immediately if they suffer an extra Injury.
      </li>
      <li>
        Deadly attacks may outright kill a character from a single Injury. The
        GM should tell players of deadly weapons, hazards, or attacks in a
        scene.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      When a character dies, all surviving characters in the group gain
      experience.
    </p>

    <h4>Willing to Die</h4>
    <p>
      A character may declare they are willing to die. The character regains all
      lost Hope and recovers one point at the start of each action. This
      declaration also removes the hopeless Truth if applicable. The character
      dies if they suffer an Injury that would defeat them.
    </p>
